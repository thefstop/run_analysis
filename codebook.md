This markdown document describes all variables present in the tidy dataset generated by the run_analysis.r program. 



Subject_ID refers to the partiipant (numbered 1 - 30) who collected the data. Activity represents the activity the participant was performing when the data were collected.  The different activities are "Walking", "Walking_Upstairs", "Walking_Downstairs", "Sitting", "Standing", "Laying".

For the remainder of the variables, they represent the accelerometer and gyroscope data collected by the participant's cell phone.  The following description is pulled from the original dataset:


```
The variables used for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAc
c-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals
(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of
0.3 Hz. 


Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals
were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag,
tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ,
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to
indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

###For each observation, the data shown represents the mean for that variable for all instances of that  Subject and Activity.
